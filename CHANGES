- Add support for writing surfaces in FreeSurfer ASCII surface format: 'write.fs.surface.asc'
- Turn return value data structure of read.fs.mgh into 'fs.volume' class and implement 'print' and 'is' S3 methods
- Support reading the ASCII version of FreeSurfer curv format files (integrated into read.fs.curv)
- Support reading the FreeSurfer weight or 'w' format files (read.fs.weight), both ASCII and binary subtypes are supported
- Add support for reading binary patch files
- Add support for reading ASCII patch files
- Fix skipping header bytes while reading mgz files (issue #10)
- Read fov MR acquisition parameter from MGH header, make mr_params parameter of write.fs.mgh length 5 from 4
- Compute dof and various other header fields from MGH header data, add new functions to derive matrices
- Add a third vignette that explains how to compute the MGH header data


Version 0.1.7
-------------
- Fix input data check in write.fs.mgh
- Turn return value data structure of read.fs.annot into 'fs.annot' class and implement 'print' and 'is' S3 methods
- Turn return value data structure of read.fs.label into 'fs.label' class and implement 'print' and 'is' S3 methods
- Support 'fs.label' instances as parameter for 'write.fs.label'
- Turn return value data structure of read.fs.surface into 'fs.surface' class and implement 'print' and 'is' S3 methods


Version 0.1.6
-------------
- Add support for reading color lookup table (LUT) files, like FREESURFER_HOME/FreeSurferColorLUT.txt: read.fs.colortable
- Add support for writing LUTs: write.fs.colortable
- Add support for extracting a LUT from an annotation: colortable.from.annot
- Add support for writing annotations: write.fs.annot


Version 0.1.5
-------------
- Add function write.fs.label() to write label files
- Docs: Remove commas from parameter names in doc strings
- Infrastructure: Add DOI generation for github releases via zenodo.org


Version 0.1.4
--------------
- Docs: link related via families, so they show up in the 'see also' section
- Fix errors in indexing example of the vignette (PR #7, thanks @AndrewLawrence)
- Fix bug in reading faces of surfaces (bug #8, thanks @AndrewLawrence)


Version 0.1.3
--------------
- Add support for reading label files (like subject/label/lh.cortex.label)
- Add example label file

Version 0.1.2
---------------
- Add support for reading and writing surface files
- Hide internal header data in return value of read.fs.mgh
- Add example surface file
