## Contributing to freesurferformats

I am very happy to accept [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), provided you are fine with publishing your work under the [license of this project](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats#license). If your PR is not just a fix but changes or adds lots of code, please get in touch by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/freesurferformats/issues) before starting the project so we can discuss it first. Development currently happends on master.

If you want to contribute something, the general workflow is:

- Log into the Github website and fork the freesurferformats repository to your account.
- Checkout your forked repository to your computer. You will be on the master branch.
- Create a new branch and name it after your feature, e.g., `add_cool_new_feature` or `fix_issue_17`.
- Make changes to the freesurferformats code and commit them into your branch. 
- Make sure the unit tests are all green. Adding new tests for your fix or the new features is great.
- Create a pull request, requesting to merge your branch into the master of my freesurferformats repo.
