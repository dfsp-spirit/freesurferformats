\usage{
ni2header.template()
}
\value{
named list, the NIFTI v2 header. All fields are present and filled with values of a proper type. Whether or not they make sense is up to you, but you will most likely have to adapt at least the following fields to your data: `dim_raw`, `datatype`, `bitpix`.
}
\description{
Create a template NIFTI v2 header. You will have to adapt it for your use case.
}
\note{
Commonly used data type settings are: for signed integers datatype = `8L` and bitpix = `32L`; for floats datatype = `16L` and bitpix = `32L`. See the NIFTI v2 standard for more options. You may want to call \code{\link{ni2header.for.data}} instead of this function.
