\description{
Read morphometry data from FreeSurfer NIFTI v1 format files.
}
\note{
This function uses our internal NIFTI reader that supports NIFTI v1 files with the FreeSurfer hack. This function assumes that the data in a file is a 1D vector and flattens it accordingly. It is not suitable to load NIFTI files with arbitrary dimensions.
