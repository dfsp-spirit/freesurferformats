\title{Write mesh to file in Wavefront object (.obj) format}
\usage{
write.fs.surface.obj(filepath, vertex_coords, faces, vertex_colors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{string. Full path to the output surface file, should end with '.vtk', but that is not enforced.}

\item{vertex_coords}{n x 3 matrix of doubles. Each row defined the x,y,z coords for a vertex.}

\item{faces}{n x 3 matrix of integers. Each row defined the 3 vertex indices that make up the face. WARNING: Vertex indices should be given in R-style, i.e., the index of the first vertex is 1. However, they will be written in FreeSurfer style, i.e., all indices will have 1 substracted, so that the index of the first vertex will be zero.}

\item{vertex_colors}{vector of vertex colors. Will be written after the x, y, z coords on vertex lines. WARNING: This is NOT part of the official OBJ standard, and may not work with other software and even break some parsers.}
}
\value{
string the format that was written. One of "tris" or "quads". Currently only triangular meshes are supported, so always 'tris'.
}
\description{
The wavefront object format is a simply ASCII format for storing meshes.
}
\note{
Do not confuse the Wavefront object file format (.obj) with the OFF format (.off), they are not identical.

\donttest{
    # Read a surface from a file:
    surface_file = system.file("extdata", "lh.tinysurface",
     package = "freesurferformats", mustWork = TRUE);
    mesh = read.fs.surface(surface_file);

    # Now save it:
    write.fs.surface.obj(tempfile(fileext=".obj"), mesh$vertices, mesh$faces);
